- main.bicep, param.json and paramwin.json are the template files used in this flow.
- replace.py and replacyDefaults.py are the scripts for replacing parameter values in the json templates.
- The UiPath repo is not present in this github repository. This is because confidential Azure information is stored within this flow. Images of the actual flow can be found in the thesis.
